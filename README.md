# Slack Feeling Lucky for Alfred

There is already an [Alfred workflow for slack](https://github.com/yannickglt/alfred-slack) but it requires a custom Slack App. As far as I know, we can't install custom applications if we aren't the owner of the Slack group. I still wanted to be able to quickly open a conversation in Slack using Alfred. This solution might come out hacky but you can give it a try and maybe improve it.

## Usage

Type `slack <query>` and press `return` to open Slack and open the conversation according to the `query`.
